# Click & Drop Print Helper

Click & Drop Print Helper is a tool designed to automate the printing of labels, packing slips, and proof of postage documents from the Click & Drop service. The application now includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with a system tray icon, configuration windows, and the existing console version for command-line usage.
